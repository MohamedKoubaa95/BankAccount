This application provides 3 functionalities:
 - Deposit money in bank account
 - Withdraw money from bank account
 - Check balance and track transactions This project is created as a command line application as no frontend was requested and my understanding is that the task is backend only. 
Only one bank account is being used as the creation of bank accounted was not in the user stories. Data is saved in and retrieved from JSON files instead of a relational database to make testing the application easier and for simplicity sake.
MVC architecture was not used as I didn't treat it as a web project.
